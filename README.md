# Trackgenix S.A
```
The company Trackgenix SA provides software development services to other companies.
In the development of a web system which we will call "Trackgenix" that will facilitate the
registration of hours worked by each employee in each project and work team, we must start with the
HTML structure of the landing page of the system requested by the company.
```

## Usage

```
To enter the project index, download the entire project from the github repo. Both index and assets. Once downloaded, click on the index and it will open the project on the browser from the local file.

## Week 02
```
##  Task Done
```
## Header
```
The Header has an image that contains the logo, and the name of the company that develops the requested software. And an H1 Tag as the main title of the page that contains the name of the Trackgenix company.
```
## Aside
```
The aside contains a menu of options which has a link to the menu, to a registration sector, to a login sector or also to the contact information of the company
```
## Main
```
The main part is divided into sections by <Section> tags detailing the benefits you will find when hiring the services of the company and its advantages in the organization.
It has a specific form to contact the company.
In addition to knowing the history and a small map of the site that will guarantee easy access.
```
## Footer
```
The footer where you will find the access links to the company's social networks.
```
## Week 03
```
In week 3 we include style to the html structure created in week 2, respecting the range of colors provided by the client, although some parts of the structure were modified.

The styles were thought from the parent containers to the children, maintaining that order of priority, the code is thought from top to bottom and from left to right.
That is, the style of the header was developed first, then the sidebar, then the main bar and finally the footer, separating different sections with line margins and colors.
